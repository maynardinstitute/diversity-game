			<h3>Are You Up for the Challenge?</h3>
			<p>
			Welcome to the online interactive game that challenges players to diversify a typical newsroom, while testing their basic knowledge of cultures. 
			</p>
			<p>
			You've just been appointed editor of a mid-size newspaper, and the publisher has asked you to move aggressively to diversify newsroom staffing and the paper's content. You must set policy and make strategic decisions that will bring the racial makeup of your newsroom into parity with the surrounding community within four years. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Choose from three levels of difficulty: <a href="javascript:popUp('./01.swf')"><b>Level 1</b></a> | <a href="javascript:popUp('./02.swf')"><b>Level 2</b></a> | <a href="javascript:popUp('./03.swf')"><b>Level 3</b></a>
